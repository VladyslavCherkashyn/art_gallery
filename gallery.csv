Found art in my youth,however had to abandon it as life took me on a different path. I re-discovered her passion during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 and it became an escape route away from the daily worries and routine which hung around like a dark cloud. With art, a new chapter in my life opened up just as I entered my mid-life, which has been a welcome change. Art comes and goes to me every day, allowing me the freedom and to paint and enjoy the whole process only when inspiration comes around, never having to force herself to do it."",Painting,vaida.saudargiene@yahoo.com";

His first career choice was primary school teaching, but during his training he also attended night art school in Leeuwarden, capital town of Friesland. He then became head of a Summerhill type school, emphasising the individual needs of the pupils. Art remained part of his life and in 1998 he took the step to dedicate all of his time to art.";

Recently he designed a war memorial for his village near The Hague. His paintings are exhibited in his own country and in Belgium, Britain and the Czech Republic.

"I like to work in eco-art and other types of socially important genres of contemporary art. I am inspired by what is happening around us. Ideas like the lightning sparkle in me. Sometimes it’s not easy to immediately realize an idea, I like to combine unusual things and surprise. I want to draw attention to open questions, such as preserving the environment, by using unusual materials in my work, as well as how beautiful a woman’s portrait is in black and white shadow. I have many ideas, but my main goal is to tell people in an accessible and interesting language how important is the preservation of the purity of our ecology and beauty will save the world and love makes us wiser."",""Painting, Photography, Sculpture"",elena.bandurka@outlook.com";

;
Light installation objects have been created during the period of over 25 years as a result of creative needs or rather personal satisfaction. Over time, that need has evolved into a passion and, finally, into purpose and procedure that suits my character and way of thinking, my need to create with my hands and my esthetic expression. The symbolism of this work is often universal, dealing with themes such as life, death, religion, hope, fear, sex, love, appearance, disappearance, and everything else we ask ourselves about. My creations are almost always inspired or made by the remnants from junkyards. The initial forms arise from those remnants and stay originally as they are or are transformed, through different procedures, into something else i.e. lighting objects. Those pieces found on junkyards, unlike modern objects, are made of metal, and their very design and original shape is enough interesting to me and worthwhile of preservation.;
;
"Coincidence plays important role in every piece – both in the process of finding it and creating it, as well as the notion that coincidence itself is a force of creation, even though it does not appear to be so. For the object – no matter if I found it or bought it on flee-markets – I have never known its final shape, or the symbolism it may finally convey, but I have sometimes had a hunch and tried to follow it. It must have been the thing that motivated me to pick that particular thing from the junkyard, together with my curiosity about what kind of shape and meaning it may take: those thrown away remains of once useful objects. Every piece is the unique one, I was made more than 250  unique pieces."",Sculpture,stanko.beros@gmail.com";

I loved magical realism and surrealism, I had one outspoken favorite: Carel Willink. I found his work very fascinating. I also loved Salvador Dali.Circumstances prevented me from pursuing an art education. At that moment I decided that when I retired, I would start painting, like my paragon Carel Willink.;
;
I worked on a freelance basis for various companies as a product designer. Including household appliances. I was a problem solver, innovative, also in terms of design. At a later stage in the field of “Art versus Design”. Usually a few pieces, or unique. I made everything by hand, where the aesthetic often won out over the functional. ;
;
Due to medical reasons I couldn't keep up with this and my ultimate dream finally came true: painting for whole days.;
;
In the initial phase I painted with acrylic paint. Since last year I paint with oil paint. I think this is sublime. I'm still experimenting. Wet in wet or several layers. At the moment, layer over layer is my preference.;

He grew up in the bleak world of poverty. From this drab, urban landscape grew a love for color and geometric design.";
;
The path of Ron’s life initially led not to art, but to the graphic arts world. He began as a messenger at age 15 in a graphic arts company. He delivered jobs to the most prestigious art departments in the world. He was fascinated by the beauty he was exposed to everyday. His love affair with art began and he painted his first painting inspired by Mondrian. His mind never stopped creating which led him to invent a type os seamless gutter that he sold to Alcoa in 1969.;
;
With the money, he opened his own graphic arts company, Speed Graphics, which he grew into a $25 million dollar business that employed 350 people in the heart of Manhattans advertising district. His love for art grew while interacting with some of his famous clients, artists like Salvador Dali and Andy Warhol; photographers such as Sebastiâo Salgado and David Douglas Duncan and members of the entertainment field like Jim Henson who created “The Muppets”. Over the years, Ron’s creative and innovative spirit continued to flourish. In the mid 1980’s, Ron was instrumental in creating the first giclèe print on a very sophisticated machine called the Iris. He was also influential in developing permanent pigment inks which had great color saturation.
;
"Speed Graphics was the first company in the US to have the Durst Lamda and drum scanner that exposed photographic paper utilizing a laser beam which changed photography by making pictures sharper than before. In the early 1990’s, Speed Graphics purchased the first Indigo press in the US. The Indigo printing press was the first digital printing press in the world. After selling Speed Graphics in 1998, Ron was able to focus his energy and creativity into his first love, art. Influenced by Calder, Kandinsky and Miro he began to create."",""Painting, Sculpture, Prints"",ronald.krivosheiw@yahoo.com";
